This is the documentation for my play OS project. There isn't really any goal to this project per se, aside from it being a pure learning experience. One goal, of course, is to have a "working" OS, i.e. one that can handle several tasks concurrently and schedule them in an appropriate manner to get work done. Beyond that, I imagine it will be a matter of implementing whatever features and optimizations strike my fancy at the time.

My choice of assembler will be NASM
	Primarily for ease of installation, but it does seem to work for x86 architectures which is a big plus
My choice of editor, at least until it becomes too painful, will be vim. Yes, I want to make this difficult for myself.
	This has the added benefit of being easily compatible with the WSL environment, which is what I'm using to start with for development.
	If/When this becomes too large, I may dual boot some Linux installation on a computer and work on a graphical interface.
	The other option would be to set up an X server on Windows, but that's a lot of effort.
I will also be using QEMU to emulate a CPU, especially in the earlier stages of development for quick turnaround time.
My current GCC version is 9.3.0, and I will be using this to build a cross-compiler for the i686-elf target platform.
	arm-none-eabi as the $TARGET

****************************************
** Setting Up the Testing Environment **
****************************************
Start up XLaunch with the default settings, and the -ac flags set on Windows.
export DISPLAY="grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed 's/nameserver //':0"
xeyes (test program to make sure the sytsem is set up properly)

***************
** GDB Stuff **
***************
The command in test_code.sh opens a TCP port on 26000 for use in debugging, and the environment will not continue to run until the debugger is attached.
(gdb) set architecture i8086
(gdb) target remote localhost:26000
(gdb) b *0x7c00 // Set a breakpoint at that address, * is mandatory for addresses
(gdb) layout asm // Setting up the debugger environment
(gdb) layout reg
(gdb) c // Continue the program

***********************
** Important Scripts **
***********************
test_code.sh - Sets up environment and runs the QEMU emulation
